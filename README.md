# AIJob-Search-Agent
This is a Job Search Agent that scrapes the job boards to get the relevant job postings based on user profile. This is currently WIP and is no where close to completion. I will try to complete this to the best of what i can so that I can get to implement an end to end system and also learn about Agents.

The following is how the project structure will eventually look like:-
